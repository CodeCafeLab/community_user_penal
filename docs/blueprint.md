## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Blue (#3B82F6) to convey trust and stability, inspired by the original design.
- Background color: Light gray (#F9FAFB), a very desaturated shade of blue, for a clean and modern look.
- Accent color: Purple (#8B5CF6), a contrasting color to the primary blue for highlighting interactive elements and important information.
- Headings: 'Inter', a sans-serif font, providing a clean and modern feel. It will be used to make titles and headings stand out.
- Body: 'PT Sans', a slightly warmer, more humanist sans-serif than 'Inter'. This choice aims to keep long texts readable and avoid the machined look of the interface becoming overwhelming.
- Material Icons, a comprehensive set of icons to provide clear and intuitive visual cues throughout the platform.
- Subtle transitions and animations (200-300ms) for a smooth and engaging user experience.
